├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   Manual Processes & Spreadsheets      │ ← 45K hours/year
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Oracle Hyperion/Fusion ERP        │ ← Manual data entry
│         (System of Record)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Target State:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Power BI Dashboards (Real-time)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   Python Automation & Orchestration    │ ← NEW LAYER
│   - Apache Airflow (workflow engine)   │
│   - REST APIs (integration)            │
│   - ML Models (predictive analytics)   │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Oracle Hyperion/Fusion ERP        │ ← RETAINED
│      (System of Record - stable)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Keep ERP Core** - No forced migration, Oracle remains system of record
2. **Add Automation Layer** - Python sits on top, non-invasive
3. **API-Based Integration** - Standard REST APIs, future-proof
4. **Open Source First** - Minimize licensing costs (Python, Airflow)
5. **Cloud-Ready** - Architecture enables future Azure/Snowflake migration

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Low risk (ERP proven and stable)
- ✅ Reversible (automation layer can be adjusted/removed)
- ✅ Cost-effective (open-source tools)
- ✅ Future-proof (modern architecture patterns)

## PRESENTER NOTES

### Opening (Slide 1-2):
- Set context: "We're here to discuss a strategic transformation opportunity"
- Emphasize: This is about enabling growth, not just cost cutting
- Preview: "I'll cover the opportunity, approach, financials, risks, and ask for your decision"

### Problem Definition (Slides 3-4):
- Make the pain real: "10-day close cycle puts us behind competitors"
- Use specific examples: "Last quarter we missed [customer] order due to stockout"
- Connect to strategy: "Manual processes are constraining our growth"

### Solution Vision (Slides 5-7):
- Show the "after": "Imagine closing in 5 days with real-time visibility"
- Connect to benefits: "This frees finance team for strategic work"
- Be specific: "Sarah in Unit 4 spends 4 hours on invoicing today, will spend 15 minutes tomorrow"

### Execution Plan (Slides 8-9):
- Emphasize phasing: "We prove value before scaling"
- Highlight gate reviews: "You'll approve each phase based on results"
- Show momentum: "Month 3 quick wins build confidence for Phase 2"

### Business Case (Slides 10-11):
- Lead with conservative case: "Even at 60% realization, NPV is $8.2M"
- Address skepticism: "We've stress-tested this extensively"
- Emphasize safety margin: "We'd need to miss targets by 79% to break even"

### Risk Management (Slides 12-13):
- Don't minimize risks: "We've identified 10 major risks"
- Show mitigation: "Each has specific mitigation and contingency"
- Emphasize change management: "Technology is 30%, people are 70%"

### Governance (Slide 14):
- Emphasize oversight: "Steering committee meets monthly"
- Show metrics: "You'll see dashboard reporting weekly"
- Gate reviews: "We don't proceed without your explicit approval"

### Close (Slide 15):
- Restate recommendation clearly
- Summarize key points (ROI, risk management, strategic value)
- Ask for decision: "Seeking approval today to proceed with Phase 1"
- Open for questions

### Q&A Preparation:

**Expected Questions:**

Q: "What if we don't achieve the projected benefits?"  
A: "At 60% realization, we still generate $8.2M NPV. We'd need to miss by 79% to break even. Gate reviews ensure we catch underperformance early."

Q: "Why can't we use our current ERP's automation features?"  
A: "Oracle has some automation, but limited for our specific workflows. Python layer gives us flexibility at lower cost."

Q: "What happens if key team members leave?"  
A: "Cross-training, documentation, and vendor support mitigate this. Also why we're building Center of Excellence."

Q: "Can we do this faster?"  
A: "We could compress to 18 months, but change management would suffer. 24 months balances speed with adoption."

Q: "What if technology changes mid-project?"  
A: "API-based architecture is future-proof. We can swap components without rebuilding."

Q: "How does this compare to competitors?"  
A: "Manufacturing peers report 150-200% ROI on similar transformations. Our 187% is in line."
